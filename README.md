programming challenges

In this Repository I have four files where i have solved four programming challenges

Q 1 :- My assignment is to write a program that finds the longest increasing contiguous subsequence in a given array and prints both the length of that subsequence, and the subsequence it self. Say the array is:

int[] arr = {3, 6, 5, 1, 9, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1} The longest continuous increasing subsequence is 2, 3, 4, 5 with a length of 4. So the output of this method would be

4 2, 3, 4, 5

Q 2 :- Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1: Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] Output: 6 Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

Example 2: Input: nums = [1] Output: 1 Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

Example 3: Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8] Output: 23 Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

Q 3:- Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.

Examples: Input: arr1[] = { 1, 3, 4, 5}, arr2[] = {2, 4, 6, 8} Output: arr3[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Input: arr1[] = { 5, 8, 9}, arr2[] = {4, 7, 8} Output: arr3[] = {4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9}

Q 4:- Given an integer array, print all distinct elements in an array. The given array may contain duplicates and the output should print every element only once. The given array is not sorted.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45} Output: 12, 10, 9, 45, 2

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
